Problems of this Project:

1st of all I thought this list can be nice in [list group] with hover [tooltip].
Like hovering on any tag it will show it's definition in it's tooltip box.

But the plan didn't work because, big tooltip doesn't pop up on small responsive screens.
The tooltip boxes were getting quite big for the definitions.

Then I thought the list will look good in accordion.
But in accordion, gutter-x was giving a horizontal scroll bar in the bottom on small responsive screens everytime. So, I changed that to gutter-y.

I also tried to [fixed-top] the heading but that also didn't work accurately, it was scrolling top to it's text. So, I gave it a padding, then it's scrolling problem solved.
